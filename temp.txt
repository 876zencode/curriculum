You already have full context of the Canonical Curriculum Explorer application (Spring Boot backend + React frontend with shadcn/UI). Extend the existing system so that, after generating canonical sources and a curriculum using the JSON ingestion + LLM, the application also generates a curated list of high-quality learning materials (documentation, videos, articles, GitHub repos) for every curriculum subtopic.

Use the existing trust profile (authority, recency, clarity, depth) to evaluate and select resources.

BACKEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. Add a new `LearningResourceService`. For each curriculum subtopic:
   - Use a new LLM call to generate 5–10 authoritative resources.
   - Use the trust profile weights from the JSON to influence the LLM.
   - Resources may include: official documentation, verified tutorials, YouTube videos from authoritative instructors, GitHub repos, books, and high-quality technical articles.
   - Normalize into DTOs.

2. Add endpoints:
   GET /api/curriculum/{language}/learning-resources

3. Update the unified response so that:
   - Canonical Sources
   - Curriculum Breakdown
   - Learning Resources
   are accessible through one aggregated API call.

4. Implement clean Java OOP design:
   - Records for DTOs
   - Interfaces for services
   - LLMService reused with different prompt templates
   - LLM prompt templates stored in `/prompts` folder
   - Trust profile applied consistently

FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS:
1. In `/language/{languageName}`, add a new section:
   “Curated Learning Materials”
   Display the learning materials grouped by curriculum topic → subtopic.

2. Use shadcn components:
   - Accordion for topics
   - Cards for resource items
   - Icons for resource type (video, article, docs, GitHub)

3. No hard-coded resources. All data must come from:
   - canonical sources endpoint
   - curriculum endpoint
   - learning-resources endpoint

4. Add loading states and skeletons.

DELIVERABLES:
- Updated Java backend code for LearningResourceService, controllers, DTOs, LLM integration.
- Updated React components/pages to render the new “Curated Learning Materials” section.
- Refactored unified API response.
- Code examples of prompt templates for the LLM that generate high-authority, pedagogically sound resource lists.
- Final merged example demonstrating Java as the proof of concept.

Generate all updated file structures, code, and glue logic for both backend and frontend.
