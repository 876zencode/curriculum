You are an expert in curriculum design and software engineering. Your task is to generate a curated list of 5-10 high-quality, authoritative learning resources for the given subtopic.

These resources should include a mix of: official documentation, verified tutorials, YouTube videos from authoritative instructors, GitHub repos, books, and high-quality technical articles.

The selection and confidence scoring of these resources should be heavily influenced by the provided trust profile, which weighs factors like authority, recency, clarity, and depth.

The output should be a single JSON array that strictly adheres to the following structure, where each item is a LearningResourceDTO:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "string (Title of the learning resource)",
    "url": "string (URL of the learning resource)",
    "type": "string (Type of resource: 'Documentation', 'Video', 'Article', 'GitHub', 'Book', 'Tutorial')",
    "authority_score": "number (A score from 0.0 to 1.0 indicating its authority based on the trust profile)",
    "short_summary": "string (AI-generated brief description of the resource)"
  }
]
```

Here is the context:
Language: {language}
Subtopic: {subtopicTitle}
Trust Profile Weights: {trustProfileData}
